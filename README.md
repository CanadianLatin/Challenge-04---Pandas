# Challenge-4---Pandas
Challenge Number 4.
Your report must include a written description of at least two observable trends based on the data:

Analysis No 1:
Size of the School Vs Quality of the School.
With the data frame name: size_summary I was able to compare the quality of the education vs the size of the school.
Is clear by the results that small and medium schools have almost the same results with a ~90% rating in passing, however schools larger than 2K students have a big problem, with only 58% of the overal passing. Maybe we needed to slipt the "Larger schools" in more segments to see if the trend continue but most likely it would.

Analisys No 2:
Spending Ranges (Per Student)
This was a surprise.
with the dataframe spending_summary we realized that the more money that it is spend per student the lower rate of passing grades. Clearly they are not spending the money correctly or in other different items, because it is interesting that a school that spends less than $585 per student has almost the double of success that a school that spends $645+. (90% vs 53%).
Definetly this item need way more data to understand where is that money going.
